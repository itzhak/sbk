Todo: make that "group admin" can't add users as "admin og group"


regular work:

adding group: goto node/add/company-group, choose "List in group directory" if you want this group seen to everybody, 
              or choose "Private group" you dont want this group seen by everybody, if you want to allow registering and adding to group
			  ( For example, user/register?gids[]=4) don't choose "Private group" options
adding users to group: goto og/my click on wanted group in left side you will see group details, click on x member and choose "add members"
                     : send link user/register?gids[]=4 will add a checked checkbox for to the user's registration page 
					   for subscribing to group nid=4 (only when group is not "private group")
making user as manager of group: goto og/my click on wanted group in left side you will see group details, click on x member and choose "List"
                                 and click on "Admin create"
